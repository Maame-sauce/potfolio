            <h3>Hi</h3>

            <h1>I'm<span> Maame Boateng<br></span>An Upcoming Frontend Developer</h1>

            <p> From a young age, I was fascinated by computers. I loved figuring out how they worked, whether it was
                fixing small technical issues, exploring different software, or experimenting with settings. My
                curiosity grew stronger in high school when I was introduced to coding through Computer Applications
                Technology. I found it exciting to write programs and see them come to life, and I knew this was a field
                I wanted to explore further.
                To build a solid foundation in both business and technology, I pursued N4, N5, and N6 certificates in
                Business Management and will complete my N6 in July 2025. In addition, I am working towards an NQF Level
                5 certificate in coding, which has allowed me to dive deeper into software development, problem-solving,
                and logical thinking. My education has given me a well-rounded perspective on how technology can be used
                to drive business success.</p>

            <h3>Upcoming Frontend <span>Developer</span></h3>
            <p>When I first discovered coding in high school, I was drawn to its logic and creativity. I realized that
                programming isn't just about writing code—it's about solving real-world problems. That passion only grew
                when I joined the PLP Academy program, where I’ve had the opportunity to explore different programming
                languages, work on hands-on projects, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Every challenge I
                solve in coding feels like a puzzle, and I enjoy the continuous learning process that comes with it.
                My goal is to combine my business and IT knowledge to help companies make data-driven decisions and
                improve efficiency through technology and automation. I am especially interested in data analysis,
                software development, and problem-solving using technology.I am eager to gain professional experience in
                the IT field, work on real-world projects, and continue developing my skills to make an impact in the
                industry.</p>
